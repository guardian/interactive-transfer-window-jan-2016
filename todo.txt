Add sale figues around line 127
// add sales to each object here or in getPlayerArr



TREEMAP
1. Colors not great
2. Treemap slice on mobile view
3. Text overflowing on small screens

OTHER
1. Get data in to featured signings at top
	a - use the most expensive signings for now

2. CSS needs a major check, view the page in composer

3. Make a decision on bottom graph/table
	a - add headline figures for each club (look at tsunami ia)
	b - move it to top of section 
	c - remove it
	d - pie charts

V2
1. Add sell data to treemap
	-Look at adding this to children in rootJSON
	-In d3 function give this a different visual treatment, consider using 2 shades throughout to show this consistently
2. reinstate filter so that user can select nationalities etc
	-This should be done by passing a variable from the filter and regenerating the rootJSON data accordingly.
		Will need to give the rootJSON a more generic name than “All clubs” 


DO THE OTHER section first
